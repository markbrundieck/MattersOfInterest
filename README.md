Purpose: Illustrate usage of Ionic2 (using Angular2) with the use of a couple APIs.
 a. search on movie titles.
 b. search by zip code or city and state.
 
 There is also a static list of a short collection of quotes.
 
 Functionality:
 1. Navigation using collapsable side menu and tabs (for the zip/city search).
 2. Search styled text box including the use of placeholder with button that initiates a call to the API.
 3. Working with API data and binding to the client side using angular for each.
 4. Only displaying content after successful search using ngIf.
 5. Use of arrays, not only with API data, but also the collection of states that uses the name for the list for the user to select, but we send the abbreviation to the API.
 6. "Toast" pop-up messages.
 7. Dynamic creation of hyperlink that navigates user to a map of the search result location.
 8. Error handling.
 9. Debugging information includes a link to the zip code web service for testing with.
